This is an 3D modelisation from hight resolution imagery take by Blue Marbel new generation sattelite in january 2004 (look at the snow).

This is not a screen shot from Google earth, this is home made video, by our hands ! 
I made the animation and Claire edited it.

#How to do this

##Download hight resolution satellite imagery
First you need to download sources here on the [NASA blue marble plateform](http://visibleearth.nasa.gov/view.php?id=73580)
Take PNG files on alle area : A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, C2, D1, and D2
You need time and space because each file height more than 200 mo

##Merge in one georeference file
This files are not georeference, so do it :
To merge file you need .tfw files for each tiles and GDAL installed.

You can find some tutorial to do this. I will wrote it later.

Make place, you will make a file witch weigth 6 Go.

##Do animation in your animation software (Esri Globe, MAYA or Blender)
I used Esri Globe to do this because I would liked to test it and maybe make layering effects.
Finaly I think this softaware is not the good one to make 3D maps in movies (at theses scales).  
First this software is not a film making software it's a GIS software and performance are really bad.
Vectorial data haven't been drawing qas quick as necessary (you can see pixels).
The camera can't look only the sky.
I had some troubles to make HD export (1920 - 1080) and no answers on the web. Hoppfully I had to use another codec to make HD export (I used Go Pro studio codec, install gopro studio).
Animations posibilities are very simple (where to begin, any stops ?, where to finish) and the move is not smooth and unlinear.
Sunlight/shadow is a joke (there is light on the "dark side")
No sun in the sky. 
The ozone layer is not good looking and no possible to params.
I think I forgot some of theme... 

I didn't use MAYA but possibilities looks interesting. I think I will use it if I have to make 3D animated maps in movies.

Few years ago, different organisations decided to help local communities from Indawgyi lake, 
the largest lake in Myanmar, to protect the lake's nature heritage.
In 2015, some of these organisations engaged with fishermen from all around the lake participatory process to revise and create fish conservation zones.
Fishermen were able to express their feelings and needs.
